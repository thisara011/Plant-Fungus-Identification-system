Plant-Fungus Identification System using Machine Learning

This system is designed to accurately identify plant fungus using machine learning techniques. The process begins with selecting and curating a relevant dataset containing images of healthy and diseased plants. The dataset is then preprocessed and used to train a machine learning model that can differentiate between healthy plants and those affected by fungus.

After training, the model is deployed within a user-friendly web application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. This web app allows users to upload images of plants, and the trained model analyzes these images in real-time, providing a diagnosis on whether the plant is healthy or infected with fungus.

The system is designed to be accessible and scalable, making it a valuable tool for farmers, gardeners, and agricultural professionals who need quick and reliable assessments of plant health.
